        <h1>Palma Ratio Graphs</h1>
        <p class="lead">Palma ratio is an economic indicator showing how unequal a country's society is. On this website
            I show several examples of it, including how unequal top-10 economies (nominal GDP) of the world are. Also,
            here you can find a more detailed explanation of how Palma ratio works and what it shows.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Palma Ratio shows how income / wealth is distributed in a country. That is, how unequal or equal it is. We all want to live in a world with more or less equal opportunities, don't we? This indicator can help you find countries that have made some progress with that. As well as those that haven't – or even have made it worse for their citizens.</p>

            <h5>What exactly does it show?</h5>
            <p>Palma ratio shows you the difference between income / wealth of two groups of population: top 10% earners and bottom 40% earners. The former are the richest 10% of your society, while the latter are the poorest 40% of it. It doesn't mean that the first group has mega billionaires and the latter has broke paupers. In some countries the difference is not that striking and we'll talk about it in more detail below. The middle 50% earners are not included since they represent just that – the very middle of the country's income and hence their figures won't give you a good idea of how unequal the society is.</p>

            <h5>The formula</h5>
            <p>P = (Top 10% share) / (Bottom 40% share)</p>

            <h5>What do the results tell you?</h5>
            <p>There are roughly 3 groups of results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>P &lt; 1</b> – the society is quite equal;</li>
                <li><b>P = 1</b> – the society is close to being equal;</li>
                <li><b>P &gt; 1</b> – the society might have some inequality issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In reality, P can exceed 1 significantly and that shows that a country has some serious issues. Surprisingly, it's quite common for developed countries and you might be unpleasantly surprised with how your country is in this regard. For example, according to Our World in Data (all our graphs and data are based on their data), the US has Palma Ratio of more than 5. France – more than 2 and it looks like a good result for big economies. It looks like the world is outrageously unequal these days! If it matters to you – and it should actually – perhaps you will be the one to bring about the change?</p>


            <h5>Note of warning: don't get too excited about it</h5>
            <p>Naturally, just like any other economic indicator / ratio, don't expect it to tell you the whole story. It's just one part of it. You can't see just one figure and think that it tells you all you need to know about the country and its society. Moreover, the data on incomes / wealth can be quite distorted since not every country measures it in the same way. Some countries want to look better for the outside observers and find a way to make their indicators look more appealing. And some countries are quite corrupt and the figures they use might not be perfectly true. However, it's interesting (and fun!) to see how countries compare using what we have.</p>
